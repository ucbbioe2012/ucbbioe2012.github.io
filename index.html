A decreased level of consciousness is a critical sign.</li><li>Note neurologic deficits (motor weakness, sensory loss, aphasia, visual changes) as they have anesthetic implications (e.g., succinylcholine use, positioning).</li><li>Many patients are on corticosteroids (dexamethasone) to reduce cerebral edema; check for associated hyperglycemia and hypokalemia.</li><li>Review anticonvulsant therapy (e.g., phenytoin) and note any drug interactions.</li></ul><h4>Premedication:</h4><p>Goal is anxiolysis without causing respiratory depression, which could increase ICP via hypercarbia.

A central line is recommended for monitoring CVP, administering vasoactive drugs, and managing potential venous air embolism (VAE).</li><li>Prepare infusions: vasopressors (phenylephrine) and antihypertensives (labetalol, nicardipine).</li><li>Have mannitol and/or 3% hypertonic saline readily available.</li></ul><h3>Intra-Operative Plan</h3><h4>Anesthetic Technique:</h4><p>General Endotracheal Anesthesia (GETA).</p><h4>Induction:</h4><p>A smooth induction is crucial to prevent coughing or hypertensive responses that would increase ICP. Pre-oxygenate and ensure deep anesthesia before laryngoscopy. Blunt the sympathetic response with fentanyl (3-5 mcg/kg) and/or lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg). Induce with propofol (ideal for reducing ICP) or etomidate if hemodynamically unstable. Use a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker (e.g., rocuronium) to ensure immobility.</p><h4>Maintenance:</h4><p>A balanced technique using a low concentration of a volatile agent (<1 MAC) combined with a propofol or remifentanil infusion is ideal to control ICP and allow for rapid emergence. Ventilate to normocapnia (PaCO₂ 35-40 mmHg). Use mild hyperventilation (PaCO₂ ~30-35 mmHg) only transiently at the surgeon's request for brain relaxation.</p><h4>Brain Relaxation:</h4><p>Administer mannitol (0.5-1 g/kg) or 3% hypertonic saline shortly after induction. Position with the head elevated 15-20 degrees to promote venous drainage.</p><h4>Emergence:</h4><p>A smooth emergence allowing for an immediate post-operative neurologic exam. Control blood pressure meticulously to prevent intracranial hemorrhage. Normal (Awake) Extubation is preferred. Ensure full reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Delayed Extubation is indicated for patients with significant pre-operative deficits, severe brain swelling, or a prolonged/complicated surgery.</p><h3>Post-Operative Plan</h3><h4>Immediate Post-Op Care:</h4><p>Transport to a neuro-ICU for close hemodynamic and neurologic monitoring. Continue steroid and anticonvulsant therapy.</p><h4>Complications to Monitor For:</h4><ul><li>Intracranial hemorrhage: Any acute neurologic deterioration warrants an immediate CT scan.</li><li>Cerebral edema: Can peak 24-72 hours post-op.</li><li>Seizures: Common after supratentorial craniotomy.</li><li>Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): High risk; requires prophylactic measures.</li></ul>` },

Spontaneous ventilation is contraindicated. Controlled ventilation is required.</p><h4>Hemodynamics:</h4><p>Be prepared for profound bradycardia and hypertension/hypotension during tumor dissection near vital brainstem centers.

Echothiophate can prolong succinylcholine.</p><h3>Intra-Operative Plan</h3><h4>Anesthetic Technique:</h4><ul><li>Regional Block (Peribulbar/Retrobulbar): Preferred. Anesthesia provides MAC. Dexmedetomidine is excellent.</li><li>General Anesthesia (LMA/GETA): For uncooperative patients. An LMA is ideal to avoid IOP spikes from laryngoscopy.</li></ul><h4>IOP Control:</h4><p>Most anesthetics decrease IOP. Avoid hypercarbia, hypoxia, and coughing. Succinylcholine causes a transient increase in IOP and is generally avoided in open globe cases.</p><h4>Oculocardiac Reflex (OCR):</h4><p>Pressure on the globe or traction on extraocular muscles causes sudden, profound bradycardia (V and X nerve reflex). First step is to ask the surgeon to stop the stimulus. Treat with atropine/glycopyrrolate if it persists.</p><h4>Emergence:</h4><p>An ultra-smooth emergence is vital.
